FMS project is based on LCNC (Low Code No Code) design approach

The essence of this project is that it reads configuration json files from mongodb and applies it to make the website live.

All you have to do is define the json files and add it to mongodb.

There is no need for a tool to write the above mentioned files based on https://json-schema.org standards.

You can find many examples in the https://github.com/tsahbazoglu/fms-tcma repository, which represents the Turkis Capital Market Associtaion live site.

All parameters you set in configuration files will be explained in this repository.

However, one of my friend Cihan Co≈ügun plans to create a web based tool that will satisfy fms users.
