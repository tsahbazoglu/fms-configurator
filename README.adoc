= introduction

FMS project is based on LCNC (Low Code No Code) design approach

The essence of this project is that it reads configuration scripts from mongodb and applies it to make the website live.

All you have to do is define the javascripts file and add it to mongodb.

There is no need for a tool to write the above mentioned javascripts files.

You can find many examples in the fms-tcma repository, which represents the Turkis Capital Market Associtaion live site.

All parameters you set in configuration files will be explained in this repository.

However, I plan to create a response tool that will satisfy fms users.
