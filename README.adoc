FMS project is based on LCNC (Low Code No Code) design aproach

Core of this project reads configuration scripts from mongodb and implelmnet it to bring the website to alive

All yo need to do is define the javascripts file and insert it to mongodb.

no need to have a tool to write javascripts files mentioned above.

you can find a lot of example in fms-tcma repository wich represent the live site of Turkis Capital Market Associtaion.

All parameers you set in configuration files wil be explaned in the repository.

But I plan to prepare a react tool to satisfy fms users.
